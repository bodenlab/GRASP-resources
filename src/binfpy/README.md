# binfpy: A Python library for Bioinformatics
This is the public version of binfpy: A Python library for Bioinformatics. 
The library is primarily intended for teaching bioinformatics and scientific computing at UQ.

You are free to use this code for any purpose.
The code is changing continually and a number of people contribute, so we make no guarantees to it being bug free.
In Feb 2017 we upgraded this from version 2.7 to 3.5 so beware of issues that have emerged of a semi-automatic translation.
