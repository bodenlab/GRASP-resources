# Supplementary material

This repository contains data relating to the paper - [Identifying and engineering ancient variants of enzymes using Graphical Representation of Ancestral Sequence Predictions (GRASP)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.30.891457v1)

Included are alignments, phylogenetic trees, ancestral inferences, and phylogenetic trees annotated with the ancestral labels for the following data sets


* CYP2U

* DHAD

* GDH-GOx

* KARI

As well as these, there are also the files used in the CYP2 / KARI tool comparison section of the GRASP paper.
